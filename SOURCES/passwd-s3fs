# This file can be used in two ways:
# 1) System-wide password file - Copy to /etc and make it readable only
#    by root (chmod 0640 && chown root:root)
# 2) Copy to ~/.passwd-s3fs owned by you and with 0600 permissions for
#    per-user mounts
#
# In both cases, you can specify a general access and secret, like this:
# accessKeyId:secretAccessKey
#
# or per-bucket credentials:
# bucketName:accessKeyId:secretAccessKey
